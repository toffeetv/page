  my phone broke, i think. <br>
  i was in the recovery mode thing. <br>
  but since my phone's power button is broken, <br>
  i couldn't restart it. <br>
  so i did so much google searching. <br>
  ended up downloading stuff to control my phone from my pc. <br>
  i ended up using a pen to force my power button to press. <br>
  and it worked. <br>
  i had a great time! <br>
