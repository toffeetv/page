  My Craft <br>

  <br>

  I woke up in a land so bizzare. <br>
  Laying next to a hole shaped like a scar. <br>
  A ravine it was, so deep so extended. <br>
  But wait, the land, it looks so pixelated. <br>

  <br>

  Everything is shaped like lego blocks. <br>
  Trees, hills, rivers, pigs, even a fox. <br>
  People! I thought, but they were different. <br>
  I can feel that they weren't as intelligent. <br>

  <br>

  I explored and was amazed. <br>
  This land is beautiful even if it is strange. <br>
  It feels like a game, I'M STUCK IN A GAME! <br>
  What even is my name?! <br>

  <br>

  Suddenly a tree was glitching. <br>
  Red, Green, Blue, over and over, flashing. <br>
  I woke up, it was a dream, I remember my name. <br>
  I look outside, and a tree was doing the same. <br>

  <br>
