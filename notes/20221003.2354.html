  aren't we all just pretending like all the time? <br>
  we act so differently to our family, teachers, friends, other friends, best friends, <br>
  even to ourselves. <br>
  so which one is the real me? <br>
  i'm guessing the version where i'm alone, talking to myself. <br>
  like what i'm doing right now. hello me! <br>
  i will never act like this to anyone else. <br>
  unless they're really really really close to me. <br>
  i only acted like that to someone else once. <br>
  then again that is now outdated me, like 2 years out of date. <br>
  that isn't me anymore. <br>
  that person isn't my friend anymore.
