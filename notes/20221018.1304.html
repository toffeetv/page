  <a href="../notes"> &lt; Back</a> <br> <br> <br> <br>

  my path just did a 90 degree turn. <br>
  i look back and i swear the path didn't look like that last i checked. <br>
  i look back infront, and now there's a huge wall. <br>
  i have the ingredients for a ladder, but i don't know how to put them together.
